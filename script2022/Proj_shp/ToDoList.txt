Once the boundary gdb arrives, these are things I need to do:

- skim through the gdb and make sure mandatory fields are populated:
	- ProjectID, NumClusters, FMU, District, TargetSpc
- append the data to the RAP_2022_05 (where all the other boundary gdbs were merged)
- clean up the ProjectID values. All Caps, no spaces, with district name prefix.
	- this can be done using ProjID_script.txt
- recalculate Area_Ha
- calculate lat lon
- Export as shapefile (RAP_2022_07.shp)
- run the Create RAP Survey Cluster Tool
- check and send the clusters to the foresters
- put the new projectids into the Terraflex form
