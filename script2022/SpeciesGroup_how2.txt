about SpeciesGroup.csv table:
Only those species that are listed in this table will be counted for any calculations done.
For example if the field officer finds a cucumber tree, but if the cucumber tree is not listed in the SpeciesGroup.csv table, that tree won't be counted for effective density, species comp, etc. with one exception: the plot will still marked as occupied, so the cucumber tree will still impact the site occupancy.
Ideally, this table should include all valid species codes
